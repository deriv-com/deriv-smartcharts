/**
 * The Area chart's appearance - gradient fill, line colour and line thickness - behind a
 * disclosure whose heading row is the toggle.
 *
 * Two things change this section's height, and both animate through the *same* clipped
 * box so they cannot fight each other:
 *
 *   - the disclosure, between the heading row alone and the heading plus the controls;
 *   - the chart type, between that and nothing at all, because the candle types are
 *     painted from the theme's `candleStyle` and have nothing here to configure.
 *
 * A second nested box for the chart-type half would have to re-measure a target that is
 * itself mid-transition, so instead the box's height is computed from two measurements -
 * the whole content, and the controls on their own - and the difference is the height of
 * the heading row. That does mean the controls stay mounted on the candle types; they are
 * clipped to zero height and `visibility: hidden`, so they are neither painted nor in the
 * tab order or the accessibility tree.
 *
 * `max-block-size` rather than `grid-template-rows: 0fr/1fr`, which is newer than this
 * library's browser floor. Measured with a `ResizeObserver` rather than read once, because
 * the controls reflow from two rows to three when the container is too narrow for colour
 * and thickness side by side - a height captured on mount would clip after that reflow.
 *
 * Nothing is measured until after the first paint, and no transition is armed until the
 * first measurement lands. Both matter:
 *
 *   - a layout read in `useLayoutEffect` forces a synchronous style flush while the dialog
 *     is still mounting, which painted the whole action sheet at its resting position for
 *     one frame before quill's own enter transition had begun - a visible flash of an
 *     already-open sheet;
 *   - and a height going from its unmeasured default to a measured one would animate,
 *     so the section slid open every single time the dialog was opened.
 *
 * Until that first measurement the heights come from CSS alone, which gets the same
 * geometry without anyone having to measure anything: the box is left to size itself, and
 * a collapsed panel is clipped to zero by a class. Switching to the measured numbers is
 * therefore invisible - the box is already exactly that tall.
